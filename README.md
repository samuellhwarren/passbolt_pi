# passbolt_pi
Passbolt is an amazing password repository system. This is a version that I modified and got to work on my raspberry pi using docker and docker compose! 
Here's my distro and versions on my pi.

If you have portainer, create a new stack and copy the docker-compose.yml into the stack. Make sure to edit the the <> sections. If there are double quotes, leave them, just replace between the <> or the "".

If you are using docker-compose without portainer, feel free to just drop it this file into your location, edit with Nano or your preferred text editor, and go!
